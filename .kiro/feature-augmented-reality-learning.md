# Feature Planning: Augmented Reality Learning

## Vision
Bring learning into the physical world through AR experiences that overlay educational content onto real environments using mobile devices.

## Core AR Experiences

### 1. Science Visualization
- **Chemistry**: Visualize molecular structures in 3D
- **Physics**: See force vectors and motion paths
- **Biology**: Explore 3D anatomy models
- **Astronomy**: Place planets in your room
- **Geology**: Examine rock formations up close

### 2. Historical Reconstructions
- Ancient civilizations in your backyard
- Historical battles on your desk
- Famous buildings at actual scale
- Timeline visualization in space
- Historical figures as AR avatars

### 3. Mathematical Concepts
- 3D geometric shapes
- Graph visualizations
- Fraction and ratio demonstrations
- Probability simulations
- Calculus curve exploration

### 4. Language Learning
- Label objects in target language
- AR conversation partners
- Cultural scene immersion
- Grammar structure visualization
- Pronunciation guides

## Technical Requirements

### Platform Support
- iOS (ARKit)
