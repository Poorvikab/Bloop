# Game Concept: Code Quest

## Overview
An adventure RPG where students learn programming concepts by writing actual code to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and progress through a fantasy world.

## Core Concept
- Character controlled by code commands
- Enemies defeated through algorithms
- Puzzles solved with logic
- World exploration via programming
- Magic system based on functions

## Programming Concepts Taught

### Beginner Level
- Sequential commands
- Basic loops (for, while)
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Variables and data types
- Simple functions

### Intermediate Level
- Arrays and lists
- Object-oriented basics
- Recursion
- String manipulation
- File handling

### Advanced Level
- Data structures (trees, graphs)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching)
- Design patterns
- Optimization techniques
- Debugging strategies

## Game Mechanics

### 1. Code Combat
- Write attack sequences
- Create defensive algorithms
- Optimize for efficiency
- Debug under pressure
- Combo moves via functions

### 2. Puzzle Dungeons
- Logic gate challenges
- Pathfinding problems
- Pattern recognition
- Encryption/decryption
- Resource optimization

### 3. Magic System
- Spells as functions
- Parameters for spell effects
- Return values as outcomes
- Spell libraries (imports)
- Custom spell creation

### 4. Character Progression
- Level up coding skills
- Unlock new syntax
- Learn new languages
- Expand code library
