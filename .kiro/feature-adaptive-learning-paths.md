# Feature Planning: Adaptive Learning Paths

## Vision
Create personalized learning journeys that adapt in real-time based on student performance, learning style, and interests.

## Key Components

### 1. Learning Style Detection
- Visual learners → More diagrams and videos
- Auditory learners → Podcast-style explanations
- Kinesthetic learners → Interactive simulations
- Reading/Writing learners → Text-based deep dives

### 2. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment
- Monitor success rates per topic
- Automatically adjust complexity
- Provide scaffolding when struggling
- Accelerate when mastering concepts

### 3. Interest-Based Branching
- Detect topics that excite students
- Offer related content exploration
- Connect abstract concepts to personal interests
- Create custom project suggestions

### 4. Knowledge Gap Analysis
- Identify prerequisite weaknesses
- Suggest remedial content
- Build foundational understanding
- Track concept dependencies

## Technical Requirements
- Machine learning model for pattern recognition
- Real-time performance analytics
- Content tagging system
- Recommendation engine

## Success Metrics
- Improved retention rates
- Higher engagement scores
- Better test performance
- Reduced dropout rates
- Increased time on platform

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic learning style quiz
2. **Phase 2**: Performance tracking system
3. **Phase 3**: Content recommendation engine
4. **Phase 4**: Full adaptive algorithm
5. **Phase 5**: Predictive learning paths

## Privacy Considerations
- Anonymized learning data
- Opt-in analytics
- Transparent algorithms
- Student data protection
